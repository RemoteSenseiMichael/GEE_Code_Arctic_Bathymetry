# GEE_Code_Arctic_Bathymetry

This code, written using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript (.js) API, is for large-scale mapping of inland Arctic waterbody depth (bathymetry). The GEE model uses log transformed Sentinel-2 optical imagery to predict water depths. Water depths are modelled using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The code tests Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), ML algorithms, in addition to a traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) model.
